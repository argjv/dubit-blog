    h2 Overview
    p.
      Lendingblock is a London-based company that is seeking to deploy an exchange solution for participants that want the ability to borrow or lend against their existing portfolio.
      Lendingblock seeks to replicate and ‘improve upon’ the traditional methods of securities lending and apply it to cryptocurrency markets.

      Create a medium of exchange for secure lending and borrowing between market participants
      Be the first to decentralize the process so that borrowed assets can be used for any means as the participants see fit
      Allow lenders to receive interest payments for the pledging of assets on loan
      The company has produced several alpha-stage versions of the product and are seeking to release a functional MVP in the near-term.

    h2 Commercial & Technical Strategy
    p.
      The technical implementation of Lendingblock appears to be a combination of off-chain and on-chain processes. Initial user signup and screening is required followed by a 4-phase approach to borrowing and lending.

      Specification: completing profiles and details regarding anticipated lending/borrowing amounts, collateral requirements etc
      Initiation: implementation of the smart contract between matched parties
      Servicing/operation: payment and receipt of interest payments
      Finalisation: Repayment of initial capital and transfer of collateral back to borrowing party
      Lendingblock have devised several formulas to determine collateralization methods which appear to be sound from a theoretical point of view. These can be viewed at 3.3 of the whitepaper.

      From a commercial point of view, the platform appears to heavily target institutional participants as its main clientele.

      API access will be made available to institutions allowing them to integrate borrowing and lending services into their own operations.

      Lendingblock has also expressed a desire to integrate with several wallet providers, however, no information regarding specific wallets has been provided.

    h2 Roadmap
    p.
      A detailed roadmap has not been provided. The website and company material suggest that platform development will occur in Q2 2018 while commercial launch will be in Q3 2018.

    h2 Token Sale
    p.
      Lendingblock will be issuing 1 billion tokens under the code LND.

      Private Sale — Only 5% of tokens have been allocated to ten institutions for private sale

      Presale — 40% of the tokens will be offered at Presale with a 20% discount

      Public Sale — During public sale, 10% of tokens will be offered for purchase

      Team & Advisors — Between the team, advisors, and employees, 25% of token will be held and vested

      Growth Fund — The remaining 15% of tokens are to be held in the growth fund for community incentive, partnerships and any other methods of increasing adoption of the platform.

    h2 Token Use
    p.
      The company advises that interest payments for loans paid by borrowers and received by lenders will be made using LND.

      As an example from the whitepaper, a loan of BTC secured by ETH collateral will result in lenders being paid LND by the borrower. Lenders can then use this earned LND to pay interest on loans of their own, or sell the LND in a secondary market to other borrowers.

      The valuation and pricing metrics of LND token are explained in section 8.1. of the whitepaper.

    h2 Use of Proceeds
    p.
      The Lendingblock team have provided a detailed overview of how funds raised will be used to create and deploy their solution to market. The use of funds indicates that the majority of capital will be utilized for development (50%). The remaining is split across operations, marketing and legal.
